##NASA Video and Imagery API

This app allos for user interaction with the NASA imagery API in a visually pleasing manner beyond what has been outlined by the NASA site (https://images.nasa.gov/)

Site visitors will be able to sign up/login as a registered user. Once logged in, users can view, comment and save their favorite NASA images/videos to their "Space Board". (this is where CRUD and RESTful routes will come into play)

Stretch:: A supplementary AR app will render 3D models of selected NASA images, using the NASA image displayed on the screen as a marker.
